# Chess in C++

## Description  
This project has been started as a way for me to learn and practice C++ and OOP. \
The end goal is to have a fully functional chess game with a GUI (for now I am focusing on game logic
and for that making the game playable in the terminal is way easier, as I do not have
any experience with GUIs in C++).

## Roadmap

✅ - Done \
🟡 - In progress \
❌ - Not started \
